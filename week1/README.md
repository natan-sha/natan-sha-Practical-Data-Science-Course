# Week 1: Welcome & First Steps in Python for Data

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to Practical Data Science: Tools for Social Change! This week introduces you to the power of data science for social impact and gets you started with Python programming in Google Colab.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Understand how data science is being used to tackle social challenges around the world
- Navigate Google Colab and run Python code in the browser
- Work with basic Python data types (numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries)
- Write simple Python operations and functions
- Upload a notebook to GitHub and understand version control basics

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **No prior coding experience required!**
- A web browser and internet connection
- A Google account (for Colab access)
- Curiosity about social issues and data

## 🎓 Session Structure (80 minutes)

### Lecture (40 minutes): Why Data Science for Social Impact?

**Topics Covered:**
- Real-world examples of data science for social good
  - Fighting discrimination in hiring and lending
  - Optimizing refugee resource allocation
  - Managing water scarcity in Africa
  - Public health and disease tracking
- Introduction to Google Colab
- Python basics: variables, data types, basic operations

### Tutorial (40 minutes): Your First Python Steps

**Hands-on Activities:**
- Open and explore Google Colab
- Write your first lines of Python code
- Practice with variables and basic operations
- Work with lists and dictionaries
- Create a simple "hello world" program with social impact theme

## 🏗️ Mini-Deliverable

**Assignment:** Create and upload a Colab notebook with a "hello world" exercise that introduces yourself and describes a social issue you care about.

**Requirements:**
1. **Personal introduction** using Python print statements
2. **Social issue description** stored in variables
3. **Simple list** of potential data sources for your chosen issue
4. **Basic calculations** relevant to your issue (e.g., population statistics)
5. **Upload to GitHub** repository

### Example Structure:
```python
# My introduction
name = "Your Name"
background = "Your background/field of study"
print(f"Hello! I'm {name} and I study {background}")

# Social issue I care about
issue = "Climate Change"
why_important = "Affects vulnerable communities worldwide"
print(f"I want to use data science to address: {issue}")

# Potential data sources
data_sources = [
    "Climate temperature records",
    "Sea level measurements", 
    "Extreme weather events",
    "Economic impact studies"
]

# Simple calculation
global_temp_increase = 1.1  # degrees Celsius since 1880
print(f"Global temperature has increased {global_temp_increase}°C since 1880")
```
