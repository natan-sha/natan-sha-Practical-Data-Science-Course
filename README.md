# Practical Data Science: Tools for Social Change

## 🌍 Using Data Science to Tackle the World's Most Pressing Challenges

## 🎓 What is this course about?

Applied data science is already shaping how the world tackles pressing social challenges — from fighting discrimination, to allocating resources for refugees, to managing water scarcity. This course invites students from a wide range of backgrounds — social sciences, policy, business, environmental studies, or anyone simply curious about data — to learn how to use data science tools in ways that matter.

Over fifteen weeks, you'll get hands-on experience with Python in Google Colab (no installation required), organize your work on GitHub, create interactive visualizations with Plotly, and even try your hand at building a simple application in Streamlit. You'll also see how modern AI coding assistants can serve as partners in debugging, exploration, and idea generation.

Materials for each week can be found in the `./week*` folders. See README.md for further details and instructions.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

✅ **Collect and prepare** real-world datasets for analysis  
✅ **Visualize complex information** with clear, interactive charts  
✅ **Build a basic predictive model** and interpret its results in plain language  
✅ **Share your work** through well-structured GitHub repositories  
✅ **Create and publish** a lightweight data app to communicate your findings

## � Course Curriculum

**Format:** 1 class per week (180 min) 

Each of the first 13 sessions: ~90 min lecture + ~90 min tutorial. Homework is optional except for a mid-term assignments and a capstone project.

Week 14: Open office hours for project help 

Week 15: Capstone showcase


## 🏗️ Capstone Project: Data for Social Impact

Throughout the course, you'll work toward a final individual project where you choose a social issue that matters to you and use data to explore, explain, or propose solutions.

**Your capstone will include:**

• **Data collection** from real-world sources relevant to your chosen issue  
• **Interactive visualizations** that tell a compelling story  
• **Predictive analysis** with clear, accessible interpretations  
• **A deployed Streamlit app** that communicates your findings  
• **Professional GitHub repository** documenting your work  

**Example project domains:**
- Educational equity and resource allocation
- Climate change impact analysis
- Public health and healthcare access
- Economic inequality and policy impact
- Social justice and discrimination patterns
- Global development and humanitarian aid
- Freedom of speech and censorship

This hands-on approach ensures you gain practical experience while making a meaningful contribution to causes you care about.
