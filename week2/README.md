# Week 2: Working with DataFrames (Pandas Basics)

## 📚 Overview

This week you'll learn to work with structured data using Pandas, Python's most important library for data analysis. We'll focus on loading, exploring, and cleaning real datasets related to social issues.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Load datasets from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames
- Explore dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)
- Perform basic data cleaning operations
- Calculate summary statistics and understand data distributions
- Handle missing values and rename columns appropriately
- Filter and sort data to answer specific questions

## 🏗️ Mini-Deliverable

**Assignment:** Create a notebook that summarizes key statistics of a real dataset related to social impact (exploratory data nalysis = EDA).

**Requirements:**
1. **Load a provided dataset** about education, health, or development
2. **Explore the data structure** using Pandas methods
3. **Clean the data** by handling missing values and renaming columns
4. **Calculate summary statistics** (mean, median, min, max, counts)
5. **Answer 3 specific questions** about the data using filtering/grouping
6. **Document your findings** with clear explanations
